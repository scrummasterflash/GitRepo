Our Privacy Policy describes the information collected by Fun Retro
through our website and the use of the information.

Data Collected

The data collected is used only to improve the app. We won't share your personal information, retrospective data, or anything else.

Data Security

We use a third party service called Firebase to store all data.

A board can only be accessed by people with the board URL, that provides some level of security however, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your board.

We delete all data that is older than 3 months. But we recommend you to export and delete your data after using Fun Retro to ensure it's 100% secure.

The security of your information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

You have the option to download the application code, create your own Firebase account and host it in your internal network.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.

We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

Your continued use of the Apps and Services following the posting of changes will mean you accept those changes.
